The core of the art of statistical inference is estimating the probability distribution of a given population by sampling. As a rule of thumb: the larger the sample, the closer will be its mean and standard deviation to that of the population.

In this app we can play with the population and sample parameters and compare the inferred and the original probability distributions.
